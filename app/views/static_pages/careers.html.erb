	<h1>Careers</h1>

	<p>
		I've built this website during my own path to a career as a Web Developer.  If coding is something that interests you, there are a vast array of options available to take.  I went with the programming bootcamp, <%= link_to 'The Firehose Project', 'http://www.thefirehoseproject.com' %>, and I can recommend them!  I'd suggest to do your own research and find what is right for you.  The information is out there, you just have to start doing.
